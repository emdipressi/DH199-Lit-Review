### Research goal: 

Find related how tos on the web and assess them for their functionality and ease of use. Also see how I can develop one that puts all of the good things together into one app.  

### Research Question

How can I make a user friendly app that can teach beginners and advanced alike a shabby chic cork bulletin board through the app?

### Lit Review 

The idea for this project is to develop an app that teaches someone, through the app with various teaching methods, how to create a shabby chic cork bulletin board, with a wooden frame. This is something that I did a few years ago and struggled to find directions on the internet that had a complete list of things to do--that we wanted to do in our project. In this review, I looked at apps that are already out there, DIY blogs, some from professionals and some amateurs at home, and a journal article discussing embodied cognition in the framework of woodworking. 

The app that I reviewed is a good jumping off point for the development of my app. It had good components such as videos and text and a community page part for users to post their projects. It, however, did not have any information about the frame that I want to do. From looking at the blogs from the Home Depot, DIY Network, and Woodshop Diaries, I know things that I want to include, such as pictures that accompany text, videos of the whole process. I also know what I want to stay away from too: long sentences with extraneous information, I think bulleted lists are good and longer sentences may also be relevant if the action requires it. 

My project will try to answer the question: how can I make a user friendly app that can teach beginners and advanced alike how to build a shabby chic cork bulletin board through the app? I will do this based on my research. My app will be different from the Wood Whisperer in that it will be more user friendly, have directions for picture frames. It will also be different from the other blogs I looked at because it will have steps from beginning to end: from buying the wood, to cutting it, putting it together, finishing it, and hanging it. The text will be straight to the point and clear to understand. With information from the journal by Marchand, examples of similar movements and muscular motions will be used to help cognitively how to perform each action.
